/**
 * ## What belongs at which level
 *
 * The channel is a `LogOutputChannel`, so VS Code owns the level (Output
 * panel gear icon / `Developer: Set Log Level...`) and supplies timestamps.
 * Its default is Info, which is what fixes the levels below:
 *
 * - `error`  -- an operation failed and the user has a broken thing in front
 *               of them: upstream request errors, tool invocation failures.
 * - `warn`   -- refused, shed, or truncated on purpose: admission-gate
 *               rejections, a changed TLS fingerprint, a throttled query, a
 *               dashboard listing that hit its page guardrail.
 * - `info`   -- state transitions worth one line each: the proxy and bridge
 *               starting and stopping, a certificate being trusted.
 * - `debug`  -- per-operation detail that is only useful once you are already
 *               debugging: retry attempts, API error classification.
 * - `trace`  -- per-request flow.
 *
 * Nothing on a healthy request path logs at `info` or above. A dashboard
 * panel loads a few hundred sub-resources through the proxy; one line each
 * would turn the channel into a place nobody looks.
 *
 * ## Redaction is applied here, not at the call sites
 *
 * Every message is passed through `redactSensitiveText` on the way to the
 * sink. Doing it in one place is the point: a call site that interpolates an
 * upstream error, a URL, or a registry record cannot forget, and adding a new
 * log line cannot introduce a leak. `redactSensitiveText` is idempotent, so
 * text that already went through `formatError` is unharmed.
